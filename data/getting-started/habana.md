# Habana Gaudi Add-on

The Gaudi® platform architecture is purpose-designed for Deep Learning workloads in data centers—in the cloud and on-premises. It comprises a fully programmable Tensor Processing Core (TPC) cluster with supporting development tools and libraries. With Gaudi’s programmable architecture, we give the data scientist flexibility and ease of use to migrate or build models with Habana’s SynapseAI® software stack, reference models, extensive kernel libraries, and documentation.

You can use your favorite deep learning framework, [PyTorch](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/index.html), [PyTorch Lightning]( https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accelerators/hpu.html), or [TensorFlow]( https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/TensorFlow/index.html), to design, build and train your models. 

First-generation Gaudi delivers up to 40% better price-performance than comparable GPU-based solutions—for both the EC2 DL2 instance and on-premise systems. Training with Gaudi clusters is available both in the cloud with AWS EC2 DL1 instances consisting of 8 Gaudis and on-premises with the Supermicro X12 Gaudi Training Server, also consisting of 8 Gaudis. In addition, Gaudi2, which launched in May 2022, offers substantial performance advances that enable significantly faster training of models, while preserving cost-efficiency. Gaudi2 systems will be available from Supermicro in 2H 2022 for on-premises implementation.
